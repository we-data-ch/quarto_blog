**Goal**: Learn about *data visualization* and familiarize yourself with some of the basic functions of the {[echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/index.html)}.

{[echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/index.html)} is back! And with version 4.5 the new features from version 5 of echarts.js are available now. Moreover, the morphing capabilities of echart.js have been ported to echarts4r as we will show in this post.

[Read more about it](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/)

You can morph between plot like this:

```{r cars}

library(echarts4r)

mtcars2 <- mtcars |> 
  head() |> 
  tibble::rownames_to_column("model")

e1 <- mtcars2 |> 
  e_charts(model) |> 
  e_bar(
    carb, 
    universalTransition = TRUE,
    animationDurationUpdate = 1000L
  )

e2 <- mtcars2 |> 
  e_charts(model) |> 
  e_pie(
    carb, 
    universalTransition = TRUE,
    animationDurationUpdate = 1000L
  )

cb <- "() => {
  let x = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    x++
    chart.setOption(opts[x % 2], true);
  }, 3000);
}"



```

<br/>

```{r pie, fig.cap='Morph between graphs.', tidy=FALSE}

e_morph(e1, e2, callback = cb)

```
