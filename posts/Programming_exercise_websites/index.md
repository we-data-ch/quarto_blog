I personally prefer FreeCodeCamp, W3School and Coursera. Because their content is free and the only thing we need to pay is the certification if we want it. Also, you don't need a code editor with W3School and Coursera, the exercices are online. The big plus with coursera is the variety of classes available and these are real classes.

You can chose one path or many of them, but don't waste time chosing the best of the best. Start with one that you find good. If at somepoint it doesn't fit your needs anymore change.

**Good luck on your learning journey!**
