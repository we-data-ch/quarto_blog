## Example for data science: Beyond Python - embracing R and Julia

In the realm of data science, Python often shines as the star, casting a long shadow with its popularity and widespread industry use. However, hidden in this shadow are gems often overlooked - R and Julia. These languages are not just alternatives; they are powerful tools in their own right, each with unique strengths and capabilities.

For years, the debate of "Python or R for Data Science?" has echoed in the halls of academia and industry. This question, however, harbors a misleading assumption -- that one must choose a single language to commit to for life. It's like saying you should only ever use a hammer for all your construction needs, ignoring the precision of a screwdriver or the strength of a wrench.

The Python advocates have done a stellar job, leading many to choose Python, especially since it's more prevalent in the industry. But this approach can be limiting. Why confine ourselves to the most popular or the 'chosen one' when the landscape of programming is so rich and diverse?

I once fell into the "Just use Python" trap. It was an excellent place to start, but as I delved deeper into data science, I realized the limitations of sticking to one language. My journey led me to R, a language that excels in statistical analysis and advanced data manipulation. It opened my eyes to new methodologies, better suited for certain types of data challenges.

Then came Julia, a language that blends the ease of Python with the speed of C. It was like discovering a sports car after years of driving a reliable city car -- exhilarating, fast, and efficient, especially for heavy numerical computations.

As a polyglot, I now navigate these languages with ease, choosing the best one for the task at hand. Python for its versatility and rich library ecosystem, R for its unparalleled statistical tools, and Julia for high-performance computing tasks.

The real question we should be asking is not "Which language should I choose?" but rather "Which language should I learn first?" The journey of a polyglot in data science is not about limiting oneself to a single language; it's about exploring and embracing the unique strengths of each language. It's a journey of continuous learning, adaptation, and growth.

So, whether you're a budding data scientist or an experienced analyst, remember: the world of data science is not monolingual. It's a rich tapestry of languages, each offering its own perspective on how to solve the complex puzzles of data.

## Bonus: The quirky side of my programming languages

Ah, the beloved languages of my programming life -- each one a unique character in the grand narrative of coding. But, let's be honest, they each come with their own set of quirks and idiosyncrasies. Here's a lighthearted look at the problems with my chosen languages, because after all, nothing and no one is perfect!

### R: The ponderous professor

R, oh R, you're like that brilliant professor who knows everything about statistics but takes an eternity to get to the point. Your performance can be slower than a snail racing uphill. And your love for numerical computation is so exclusive, it's as if you're saying, "Characters? What are those?". Also, it would be good if you could more often go out of your University and go in production. Life is not only about statistic you know?

### Python: The popular kid with too many friends

Python, you're slow! You're the cool kid on the block, loved by all, but sometimes you spread yourself too thin. You try to be everything for everyone, and it can lead to a lack of coherence. Plus, your popularity contest sometimes overshadows other equally deserving languages (Yes you're overrated, sorry!). And let's be honest, without C/C++ giving you your pocket money, where would you be? Maybe the shadow of Lua? Would you have as much friends? Oh, Did I mention you're slow?

### Julia: The speedy brainiac with a memory problem

Julia, you're lightning-fast, but your memory usage is like someone who shops too much on a sale day - you just can't help grabbing everything! And let's not get started on your slow compilation time. It's like waiting for a gourmet meal; great once it's there, but oh, the wait! Please, let's not talk about your executables, I don't want to ruin my mood.

### Nim: The secret agent with few contacts

Nim, you're fast and efficient, like a secret agent, but you're a bit of a loner. Seriously no one know you, you are invisible! Julia is younger than you and focus in a small community and is still more popular than you, how? Your small community and the lack of comprehensive documentation can make you feel like you're part of an exclusive club that's hard for newcomers to join. Having said that, I'm making the assumption that you really want to be discovered, but that remains to be seen...

### JavaScript: The artist with a messy palette

JavaScript, the artist of the web, your creativity knows no bounds. But sometimes, your syntax is as unpredictable as a toddler's mood swings. And the amount of boilerplate code you require -- it's like asking for a five-course meal when all I want is a sandwich!

### Embracing bias with a pinch of salt

Now, I must sheepishly admit, like many programmers, I harbor biases towards my chosen languages. It's natural; we're human, not machines. Our backgrounds, experiences, and preferences shape our choices. But the key is to be aware of these biases, not to be absolutist about our choices, and to always remain open to learning.

Every programming language has its flaws, and it's important to recognize them humorously and with a grain of salt. What's essential is understanding that these 'flaws' are often what make a language uniquely suited for certain tasks. It's not about finding the perfect language; it's about finding the right language for the right job, warts and all.

In the end, every programming language is 'bad' in its own unique and useful way. They're like friends with different personalities; some are reliable, some are flashy, some are deep thinkers, and others are social butterflies. But together, they make for a diverse and capable team. So, let's continue to embrace the quirky world of programming languages, with all its imperfections and charm!
